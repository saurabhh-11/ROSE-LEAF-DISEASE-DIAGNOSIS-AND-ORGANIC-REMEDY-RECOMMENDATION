A dataset for rose leaf diseases is currently available; 
however, it encompasses only a limited number of conditions, namely black spot, powdery mildew, and downy mildew. 
To address this gap, we have curated and created an extended dataset, which has been uploaded to Kaggle. 
I would like to include this dataset in the dataset section of our GitHub profile.
